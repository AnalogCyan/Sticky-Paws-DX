# Sticky-Paws-DX
Framework used to make Sticky Paws DX and future Jonnil platformer games

This is the framework for Sticky Paws, a platformer game that was developed in Game Maker, Sticky Paws was created by Jonnil in 2019.
I want to continue making platformer games, and this is a project that I've mostly been programming myself
when I first started out, with some major help from Pixpak and Rahim Ali later on when making Sticky Paws DX.

I really do like this little platformer framework, it's not "the perfect platformer framework" but it has stuff
that I'm still proud of, and I want to continue using it for future games, rather than starting completly from scratch.
I have already started from scratch when I made Sticky Paws DX, which this project is. If I'm going to have a chance to keep
developing games like my next platformer project, I'd rather stick to this framework that I already have.
It's a perfectly usable platformer framework, that I will continue to change and expand on.

Many things that make Sticky Paws, "Sticky Paws", are assets, which most of them are found in Included Files/Datafiles.
Characters, Levels, Resource Pack, Title Backgrounds, Title Logos...
All those folders includes the sprites, sounds, even behavior of characters and levels in Sticky Paws.
When you actually play Sticky Paws, that's where things are loaded from, Included Files/Datafiles determine a lot of what Sticky Paws actually is.
I could use the framework, but completely change what game it is with Included Files/Datafiles.
This is the kind of vision I have for this platformer framework.

For people interested in my projects, you can at least look at the code if you want to, thank you for being a fan.
Again, it's not "perfect" so any suggestions how to make it better are welcome.

The games that I myself will make with this platformer framework, will be sold for profit on Steam and such.
If you want to be so kind, please support me by buying the game on Steam.
