# Sticky-Paws-DX

_Sticky Paws DX_ is both a platformer game and a framework for future Jonnil platformer games. It was developed in Game Maker and created by Jonnil in 2019, with help from Pixpak and Rahim Ali later on.

## About the Framework

While not "the perfect platformer framework," it contains many features that we're proud of, and we plan to continue using and improving it for future games, rather than starting from scratch.

By modifying the `Included Files/Datafiles`, the framework can be adapted to create an entirely different game.

## Contributions

For fans interested in our projects, feel free to examine the code. We welcome any suggestions on how to improve the framework.

## Supporting the Project

The games created with this platformer framework will be sold for profit on platforms like Steam. If you'd like to support us, please consider buying the game on Steam.
