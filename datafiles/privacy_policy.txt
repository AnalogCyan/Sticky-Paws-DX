Privacy Policy for Sticky Paws
Last updated: December 23, 2024

This Privacy Policy explains how Sticky Paws ("we," "us," or "our") handles the data related to your use of the game. Sticky Paws is designed with a focus on creativity and fun while respecting your privacy.

### Data Collection and Use

Sticky Paws collects minimal data to support the functionality of the game, specifically features like level sharing and character customization. Here’s what we collect and how we use it:

#### 1. Uploaded Content
- **Custom Levels and Characters:** When you upload a level or character, the content itself (e.g., level design, custom sprites, and sound effects) is sent to our servers to make it available for others to download.
- **Metadata:** We collect basic information like file size, upload timestamp, and technical data necessary to ensure uploads function correctly.

#### 2. Server Interactions
- **Download Requests:** When you download a level or character, your request is logged to ensure successful delivery.
- **Debugging Logs:** Basic diagnostic information (e.g., error reports) may be collected to identify and fix server-related issues. This information does not include personally identifiable details.

### Third-Party Platforms
Sticky Paws is available on platforms like Steam and Nintendo Switch. These platforms may handle user data, purchases, and account details according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies for more information:
- Steam: [Steam Privacy Policy](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/)
- Nintendo Switch: [Nintendo Privacy Policy](https://www.nintendo.com/privacy-policy/)

### Data Retention
We retain uploaded content and metadata for as long as necessary to provide the level-sharing functionality. Debugging logs are stored temporarily to resolve technical issues.

### Data Sharing
Sticky Paws does not share your data with third parties beyond the scope of necessary server operations. Uploaded content is publicly accessible to other players who download levels or characters.

### Security
We use commercially reasonable measures to protect the data stored on our servers. However, no system is entirely secure, and we encourage users to avoid uploading sensitive or personal information in level or character files.

### Children’s Privacy
Sticky Paws does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided data through Sticky Paws, please contact us so we can address the issue.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page with the "Last updated" date.
